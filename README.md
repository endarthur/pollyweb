# Pollyweb: JupyterLite Deployment for Pollywog

This project provides a JupyterLite deployment for running [Pollywog](https://github.com/endarthur/pollywog) directly in your browser—no local Python installation required.

## What is Pollywog?
[Pollywog](https://github.com/endarthur/pollywog) is an open-source Python package for automating workflows involving `.lfcalc` files used in Leapfrog software by Seequent. It enables:

- Programmatic reading and writing of `.lfcalc` files
- Automation of complex workflows (conditional logic, domain-based dilution, post-processing)
- Integration with scikit-learn models for direct use in Leapfrog calculations
- Powerful querying/filtering of calculation sets

See the [Pollywog documentation](https://pollywog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details and tutorials.

## About This Deployment
This JupyterLite deployment lets you:

- Run Pollywog in your browser, instantly—no Python installation needed
- Explore example notebooks demonstrating Pollywog features
- Prototype and automate Leapfrog workflows interactively

## Getting Started
1. Open the JupyterLite interface (see deployment instructions or launch link)
2. Browse the `content/examples/` folder for ready-to-run notebooks:
	- `basic_usage.ipynb`: Getting started with Pollywog
	- `display_final_workflow.ipynb`: End-to-end workflow example
	- `sklearn_conversion.ipynb`: Integrate scikit-learn models
	- `querying_calcsets.ipynb`: Advanced querying
	- ...and more
3. Create your own notebooks to automate `.lfcalc` workflows

## Example: Reading and Writing `.lfcalc` Files
```python
import pollywog as pw
calcset = pw.CalcSet.read_lfcalc("path/to/file.lfcalc")
calcset.to_lfcalc("output.lfcalc")
```

## Example: Converting a scikit-learn Model
```python
from pollywog.conversion.sklearn import convert_tree
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
import numpy as np
X = np.array([[0.2, 1.0, 10], [0.5, 2.0, 20]])
y = np.array([0.7, 0.8])
feature_names = ["Cu_final", "Au_final", "Ag_final"]
reg = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=2)
reg.fit(X, y)
recovery_calc = convert_tree(reg, feature_names, "recovery_ml")
pw.CalcSet([recovery_calc]).to_lfcalc("recovery_ml.lfcalc")
```
